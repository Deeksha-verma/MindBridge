It is to provide a user-friendly interface where students can interact with the system. To generate questions of varying difficulty levels based on the student’s current performance and skill level. An adaptive algorithm is used to adjust the difficulty of questions in real-time based on the student’s performance.
the system flow is such that:
Students log into the system and access their personalized learning environment. The system may start with an initial assessment to determine the student’s baseline skill level. The adaptive algorithm retrieves the appropriate difficulty level based on current performance. The question generation engine creates a problem suited to the student’s level.
Our ideation process was such that we first identify the problem faced by neurodiverse students. After identifying the problems faced, we identified the need to built a personalized learning tool that adapts to the individual’s abilities, offering appropriate challenges and support. We Considered various approaches to address the problem, including static practice problems but decided to focus on an adaptive learning system due to its ability to tailor content to the student’s current skill level, providing a more personalized and effective learning experience.
our solution is different from the existing solutions as its center to solve a lot of problems faced by neurodiverse students. We can help dyslexic students by using speech to speech translation and dyscalculia students by helping them memorize Mathematics facts and formulas.
